The Nerpa pipeline may run the following third-party software:
* rBAN v1
The tool is provided in the Nerpa package (downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/sib-pig/rban/downloads/).
rBAN is used if `--process-hybrids` is specified and/or if input structures are in the SMILES format. 
See Ricart et al., 2019, for more information on rBAN.
The rBAN web service is available at https://web.expasy.org/rban.
rBAN is licensed under BY-NC-SA 4.0.

* antiSMASH v5
The tool should be pre-installed and added to PATH or the installation path provided via `--antismash-path`. See the installation instructions at https://docs.antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/install/.
antiSMASH is used if input genomes are in the FASTA of GenBank formats.
See Blin et al., 2019, for more information on antiSMASH v5.
The antiSMASH web service is available at http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/.
